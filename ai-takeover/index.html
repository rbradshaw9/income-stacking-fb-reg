                    During this training event, Rich Dad Expert Andy Tanner reveals the shocking truth: every previous technological revolution created more jobs than it destroyed. The Industrial Revolution displaced artisans but created factory workers. Computers replaced clerks but created software engineers.

                <p class="text-xl font-semibold text-center py-8">
                    But the AI revolution is fundamentally different. For the first time in history, we're facing technology that doesn't augment humans – it replaces them entirely. AI can now see, think, and act across virtually every domain of human work.

                <p>
                    In this free training, Andy will show you exactly why this disruption will be unlike anything we've seen before – and reveal the one path that turns this massive shift into your greatest wealth-building opportunity.
